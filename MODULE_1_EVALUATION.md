# Module 1: Data Engineering - Quality Evaluation

## Syllabus Requirements Check

### Learning Objectives
- [x] **Understand data as code**: ✅ Covered with versioning, reproducibility section
- [x] **Master data quality fundamentals**: ✅ Comprehensive data quality analysis section
- [x] **Build reproducible data pipelines**: ✅ Created clean_pokemon_data() function
- [x] **Compare pandas vs polars**: ✅ Performance benchmark section included

### Socratic Questions Covered
- [x] "If I run your data pipeline twice on the same input, will I get identical output?"
- [x] "Your model performed great in training but fails in production. What could be wrong?"
- [x] "Someone changed a column name upstream. How would you detect this?"
- [x] "When would you choose polars over pandas?"

### Hands-On Exercises
- [x] Exercise 1.1: Break the data (introduce 5 quality issues)
- [x] Exercise 1.2: Refactor messy data loading code
- [x] Exercise 1.3: Performance challenge - pandas vs polars

### Checkpoint Assessment
- [x] "New Pokemon Data Drop" - schema harmonization challenge included

### Industry Context
- [x] How companies do this at scale (small/medium/large)
- [x] Common pitfalls section
- [x] Real-world considerations
- [x] Tool recommendations (DVC, MLflow, Feast)

## Alignment with Course Goals

### Prepares for Module 2?
- ✅ Yes - foundation in data loading and cleaning
- ✅ Introduces concepts needed for EDA (data quality)
- ✅ Sets up clean dataset for feature engineering

### Production-Ready Mindset?
- ✅ Yes - emphasizes validation, testing, versioning
- ✅ Industry context throughout
- ✅ Professional code examples
- ✅ Error handling patterns

### Appropriate Difficulty?
- ✅ Yes - assumes software engineering background
- ✅ Introduces ML-specific concepts clearly
- ✅ Not too basic (respects learner's intelligence)
- ✅ Not too advanced (builds foundations)

## Potential Improvements (Optional)

### Minor Enhancements (if time permits)
1. Add more visualization of data quality issues
2. Include pytest examples for data tests
3. Add DVC commands (even if not fully implemented)
4. Include monitoring dashboard example
5. Add streaming data validation example

### Current State
**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR LEARNERS**

The module is comprehensive, professional, and aligned with learning objectives.
Any improvements are "nice to have" not "must have."

## Time Estimate Validation
- Estimated: 2-3 hours
- Content volume: Appropriate for 2-3 hour self-paced learning
- Exercise load: Reasonable for time estimate

## Final Grade: A+ (Ready to Ship)

**Recommendation**: Proceed to Module 2
