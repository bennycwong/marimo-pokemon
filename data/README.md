# Pokemon Card Dataset

## Files

- **`pokemon_cards.csv`** - Full dataset (16,000 cards)
- **`pokemon_cards_sample_1000.csv`** - Sample dataset (1,000 cards) for quick testing
- **`clean/`** - Directory for cleaned datasets (generated by Module 1)

## Dataset Overview

### Comprehensive Pokemon Card Dataset
- **16,000 total cards** covering all generations (1-9)
- **18 Pokemon types**: Water, Fire, Grass, Electric, Psychic, Fighting, Dark, Dragon, Normal, Steel, Fairy, Bug, Ghost, Rock, Ground, Ice, Flying, Poison
- **8 rarity levels**: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Rare Holo, Rare Holo EX, Rare Holo GX, Rare Ultra, Secret Rare
- **1,476 unique Pokemon** with realistic variants (EX, GX, V)
- **Card prices** based on rarity, stats, and legendary status ($0.04 - $2,391.53)

### Features

Each card includes:
- `name`: Pokemon name (with variants like EX, GX, V)
- `type`: Primary Pokemon type
- `hp`: Hit points (30-340)
- `attack`: Physical attack stat (10-200)
- `defense`: Physical defense stat (10-200)
- `sp_attack`: Special attack stat (10-200)
- `sp_defense`: Special defense stat (10-200)
- `speed`: Speed stat (10-200)
- `generation`: Generation 1-9
- `rarity`: Card rarity level
- `is_legendary`: Boolean indicating legendary status
- `set_name`: Card set/expansion name
- `price_usd`: Market price in USD

## Generation Methods

### Option 1: Comprehensive Synthetic Dataset (Recommended) ✅

**File**: `generate_comprehensive_dataset.py`

Creates a large-scale, realistic dataset with:
- All real Pokemon names organized by type
- Type-specific stat distributions
- Generation-based card counts matching TCG history
- Realistic rarity distributions
- Price modeling based on rarity and stats

**Usage**:
```bash
uv run python data/generate_comprehensive_dataset.py
```

**Output**:
- `pokemon_cards.csv` (16,000 cards)
- `pokemon_cards_sample_1000.csv` (1,000 cards)

**Advantages**:
- Fast generation (< 1 second)
- No API dependencies
- Consistent and reproducible
- Realistic distributions for ML learning

### Option 2: Original Small Dataset

**File**: `generate_dataset.py`

Creates a smaller synthetic dataset (800 cards) with intentional data quality issues for educational purposes.

**Usage**:
```bash
uv run python data/generate_dataset.py
```

**Output**:
- `pokemon_cards.csv` (800 cards with quality issues)

**Advantages**:
- Includes intentional data quality issues for Module 1
- Smaller size for quick experimentation
- Good for learning data validation

### Option 3: Real Pokemon TCG API (Experimental)

**File**: `fetch_real_pokemon_cards.py`

Attempts to fetch real card data from the Pokemon TCG API (https://pokemontcg.io/).

**Status**: ⚠️ Currently experiencing API timeout issues

**Usage**:
```bash
uv run python data/fetch_real_pokemon_cards.py
```

**Note**: The API may be rate-limited or temporarily unavailable. We recommend using Option 1 (comprehensive synthetic dataset) instead.

## Using the Dataset

### For ML Course Modules

The comprehensive dataset is designed for:

1. **Module 0 (Business Context)**: Price prediction use case
2. **Module 1 (Data Engineering)**: Large-scale data validation
3. **Module 2 (Feature Engineering)**: Rich feature space
4. **Module 3 (Model Training)**: Sufficient data for training/validation/test splits
5. **Module 4 (Evaluation)**: Multiple rarities and types for analysis
6. **Module 5 (Deployment)**: Realistic inference scenarios
7. **Module 8 (Capstone)**: End-to-end price prediction project

### Quick Start

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load full dataset
df = pd.read_csv("data/pokemon_cards.csv")
print(f"Loaded {len(df)} cards")

# Load sample for quick testing
df_sample = pd.read_csv("data/pokemon_cards_sample_1000.csv")
print(f"Loaded {len(df_sample)} sample cards")
```

### Dataset Quality

**Advantages for ML Learning**:
- Large enough for meaningful train/val/test splits (16,000 cards)
- Realistic type distributions
- Multiple generations for temporal analysis
- Price data for regression tasks
- Legendary vs non-legendary for classification
- Rarity imbalance for handling class imbalance

**Intentional Characteristics**:
- Class imbalance (realistic to Pokemon TCG)
- Price variance (realistic market dynamics)
- Stat correlations (realistic to Pokemon game mechanics)
- Generation bias (newer gens have fewer cards, as in reality)

## Regenerating the Dataset

To regenerate with different characteristics:

```bash
# Generate fresh comprehensive dataset
uv run python data/generate_comprehensive_dataset.py

# Or generate small dataset with quality issues
uv run python data/generate_dataset.py
```

The generators use `random_seed=42` for reproducibility. Modify the seed in the script for different variations.
